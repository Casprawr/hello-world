### About

This is a fun little project where GitHub users can come and provide a little blurb about themselves for the strange folk of the internet. To contribute, simply submit a Pull Request with your GitHub username, "Hello, World!", and a tidbit about yourself (or a random observation or just something random) - see the examples below for format and inspiration.

Made with :heart: for [GitHub Patchwork](https://github.com/blog/1894-patchwork-night-sf-edition).

| [@todd](https://github.com/todd) | Hello, World! I have written approximately 1/5 of all my own code while wearing only pajama pants. |
|[@manfrin](https://github.com/manfrin) | Hello, World! I think the wiki page for [List of Unusual Deaths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unusual_deaths) is the single best page on wikipedia. Chrysippus's death-by-laughing is my favorite. |
| [@sdkkds](https://github.com/sdkkds) | Hello, World! [All GLORY to the Hypnotoad](http://r33b.net/). |
| [@kimtaro](https://github.com/kimtaro) | Hello, World! I enjoy long walks in the forest and Unicode regular expressions. |
